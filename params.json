{"name":"Vim","tagline":"Mirror of the Vim Mercurial repository","body":"README.txt for version 7.3 of Vim: Vi IMproved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS VIM\r\n\r\nVim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features\r\nhave been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,\r\non-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations, etc.\r\nThere is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See\r\n\"runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt\" for differences with Vi.\r\n\r\nThis editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.\r\nAll commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type\r\nwith ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be\r\ndefined by the user, and the mouse can be used.\r\n\r\nVim runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows (95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP, Vista,\r\n7), Atari MiNT, Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of\r\nUNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThere are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.\r\nThis README.txt file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the\r\ndocumentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run\r\nVim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.\r\nWhich one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you\r\nwant or must compile it yourself.  Check \"http://www.vim.org/download.php\" for\r\nan overview of currently available distributions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nThe vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Mostly it can be\r\nstarted as \"vimtutor\".  See \":help tutor\" for more information.\r\n\r\nThe best is to use \":help\" in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read\r\n\"runtime/doc/help.txt\".  It contains pointers to the other documentation\r\nfiles.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use\r\nVim.  See \":help user-manual\".\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYING\r\n\r\nVim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are\r\nencouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file\r\n\"runtime/doc/uganda.txt\" for details (do \":help uganda\" inside Vim).\r\n\r\nSummary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an\r\nunmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license\r\ntext must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.\r\nThe license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and\r\ndistribute it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPONSORING\r\n\r\nFixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show\r\nyour appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue\r\nworking on Vim please send a donation.\r\n\r\nSince Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children\r\nin Uganda.  See runtime/doc/uganda.txt.  But at the same time donations\r\nincrease Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!\r\n\r\nFor the most recent information about sponsoring look on the Vim web site:\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.vim.org/sponsor/\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILING\r\n\r\nIf you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you\r\nobtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the\r\n\"src\" directory.  See src/INSTALL for instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nSee one of these files for system-specific instructions:\r\nREADME_ami.txt\t\tAmiga\r\nREADME_unix.txt\t\tUnix\r\nREADME_dos.txt\t\tMS-DOS and MS-Windows\r\nREADME_os2.txt\t\tOS/2\r\nREADME_mac.txt\t\tMacintosh\r\nREADME_vms.txt\t\tVMS\r\n\r\nThere are more README_*.txt files, depending on the distribution you used.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe latest news about Vim can be found on the Vim home page:\r\n\thttp://www.vim.org/\r\n\r\nIf you have problems, have a look at the Vim FAQ:\r\n\thttp://vimdoc.sf.net/vimfaq.html\r\n\r\nIf you still have problems or any other questions, use one of the mailing\r\nlists to discuss them with Vim users and developers:\r\n\thttp://www.vim.org/maillist.php\r\n\r\nIf nothing else works, report bugs directly:\r\n\tBram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN AUTHOR\r\n\r\nSend any other comments, patches, flowers and suggestions to:\r\n\r\n\tBram Moolenaar\t\tE-mail:\tBram@vim.org\r\n\tFinsterruetihof 1\r\n\t8134 Adliswil\r\n\tSwitzerland\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
